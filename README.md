# C++ DSA Engine 

A high-performance logic library for Data Structures and Algorithms. This repository serves as a modular toolkit used for building complex applications and solving competitive programming problems.

## Features
- **Modular Design:** Logic is decoupled from UI, stored in `solver.h`.
- **0ms Performance:** Optimized frequency array techniques for string manipulation.
- **Test-Driven:** Includes a `main.cpp` runner to verify logic before deployment.

##  Project Structure
- `solver.h`: The core library containing algorithmic solutions.
- `main.cpp`: A lightweight testing file to verify logic.

##  Optimized Solutions Included
- **Valid Anagram (LeetCode #242):** $O(N)$ time complexity using frequency arrays.
- **Ransom Note (LeetCode #383):** $O(N)$ time complexity with early-exit optimization.
